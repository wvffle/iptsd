[Config]
##
## The following values are device specific and will be loaded from /usr/share/iptsd
## Only set them if you need to provide custom values for new devices that are not yet supported
##
# InvertX = false
# InvertY = false
# Width = 0
# Height = 0

[Touchscreen]
##
## Disables the touchscreen. No data will be processed.
##
# Disable = false

##
## Ignore all touchscreen inputs if a palm was registered.
##
# DisableOnPalm = false

##
## Ignore all touchscreen inputs if a stylus is in proximity.
##
# DisableOnStylus = false

##
## How many centimeters a contact can be outside of the screen and still get registered.
##
# Overshoot = 0.5

[Touchpad]
##
## Disables the touchpad. No data will be processed.
##
# Disable = false

##
## Ignore all touchpad inputs if a palm was registered.
##
# DisableOnPalm = false

##
## How many centimeters a contact can be outside of the touchpad and still get registered.
##
# Overshoot = 0.5

[Contacts]
##
## How the neutral value of the heatmap will be determined.
## The neutral value is the value in the heatmap that marks regions without activity.
## Pixels with a value larger than the neutral value are considered for blob detection.
##
## Mode: The most common value from the heatmap will be used.
## Average: The average of all values from the heatmap will be used.
## Constant: The value from the NeutralValue option will be used.
##
## When this option is set to Mode or Average, the NeutralValue option can be used
## to specify an offset that will be added on top of the calculated value.
##
# Neutral = mode

##
## The neutral value of the touch sensor (Range 0 - 255).
##
# NeutralValue = 0

##
## The activation threshold for blob detection (Range 0 - 255).
## If a pixel of the heatmap is larger than this value plus the neutral value, the blob detector
## will mark the pixel as a contact and try to determine its size.
##
## This value is only used by the basic blob detector.
##
# ActivationThreshold = 24

##
## The deactivation threshold for blob detection (Range 0 - 255).
## Once the blob detector has identified a contact it will look for adjacent pixels. If the value
## of the pixel is larger than this value plus the neutral value, it will be added to the contact.
##
## This value is only used by the basic blob detector.
##
# DeactivationThreshold = 20

##
## How many centimeters a contact must increase in size before the change is considered stable.
## Size changes below this threshold are ignored.
##
# SizeThresholdMin = 0.1

##
## How many centimeters a contact can increase in size before the change is considered unstable.
## Size changes above this threshold are ignored.
##
# SizeThresholdMax = 0.5

##
## How many centimeters a contact must move before the movement is considered stable.
## Movements below this threshold are ignored.
##
# PositionThresholdMin = 0.04

##
## How many centimeters a contact can move before the movement is considered unstable.
## Movements above this threshold are ignored.
##
# PositionThresholdMax = 2

##
## How many degrees the orientation of a contact must change before the change is considered stable.
## Changes below this threshold are ignored.
##
# OrientationThresholdMin = 1

##
## How many degrees the orientation of a contact can change before the movement is considered unstable.
## Changes above this threshold are ignored.
##
# OrientationThresholdMax = 5

##
## The minimal diameter a contact must have.
##
# SizeMin = 0.2

##
## The maximal diameter a contact can have.
##
# SizeMax = 2.0

##
## The minimal aspect ratio a contact must have.
##
# AspectMin = 1.0

##
## The maximal aspect ratio a contact can have.
##
# AspectMax = 2.5

[Stylus]
##
## Disables the stylus. No stylus data will be processed.
##
# Disable = false

##
## The distance between the stylus tip and the position transmitter, in centimeters.
## This setting adds a tilt-derived offset to the position reported by the stylus,
## with the goal of aligning it to the tip of the pen. The higher this value and / or
## the tilt of the stylus, the higher the offset will be.
##
# TipDistance = 0

##
## The time in seconds to wait before the stylus is considered lifted.
## This is useful for devices that wrongly report stylus lift events when palm is on the touchscreen.
##
# LiftTimeout = 0.07

# PositionMinAmp = 50
